# Watch App Integration Instructions

The Watch app code is ready but needs to be manually added to Xcode. Here's how to do it:

## Steps to Add Watch App Target

1. **Open Xcode** (already opened)

2. **Add Watch Target**:
   - Go to File → New → Target
   - Select watchOS → App
   - Name: "NotedWatch" 
   - Bundle Identifier: `com.noted.NotedCore.watchkitapp`
   - Interface: SwiftUI
   - Language: Swift
   - Include Notification Scene: Unchecked
   - Click Finish

3. **Replace Generated Code**:
   - Delete the generated ContentView.swift
   - Copy the code from `NotedWatch/Sources/NotedWatchApp.swift` to your new Watch app
   - Or use the code from `WatchTestApp.swift` (already has the picker style fixed)

4. **Configure Connectivity**:
   - The WatchConnectivityManager is already set up in the main app
   - The Watch app will automatically connect when both apps are running

## Watch App Features

The Watch app provides:
- Quick recording start/stop
- Room selection (Emergency Dept, ICU, OR, Recovery, Clinic, Radiology)
- Recording duration display
- Bookmark functionality
- History access
- Pause/resume during recording

## Testing

1. Make sure both iPhone and Watch simulators are paired (already done)
2. Build and run the main NotedCore app on iPhone
3. Build and run the NotedWatch app on Watch
4. Test recording functionality across both devices

## Current Status

✅ Watch simulator booted and paired with iPhone
✅ Watch app code prepared
✅ Picker style fixed for watchOS compatibility
⏳ Manual Xcode integration needed

The Watch app is ready to be integrated - just needs the manual Xcode target creation step.
