# 🔍 Debug Transcription Issues - What to Check

## App is Running (PID: 26734)

## Check These in Xcode Console:

### 1. When App Launches:
Look for these messages:
- `🚀 SimpleWhisperService starting...`
- `📥 Loading WhisperKit...`
- `✅ WhisperKit loaded successfully!` OR `❌ Failed to load WhisperKit`

### 2. When You Tap Record Button:
Look for:
- `🎤 Starting recording...`
- `📱 Requesting audio service start...`
- `🎙️ Starting audio capture...`
- `✅ Permission granted`
- `✅ Audio engine started successfully`
- `📊 Engine is running: true`

### 3. While Recording (CRITICAL):
You should see REPEATED messages like:
- `🎤 Processing audio buffer with 512 frames`
- `🔊 Audio detected! Max amplitude: X` OR `🔇 Silence detected`
- `📥 SimpleWhisperService.processAudio called with X samples`

### 4. If NO Audio Messages:
The problem is the audio engine isn't capturing. Check:
- macOS System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone → Xcode ✅
- Simulator → Device → Microphone (should be enabled)

### 5. If Audio Messages but No Transcription:
Look for:
- `⚠️ WhisperKit not ready` - Model hasn't loaded
- `❌ Failed to load WhisperKit` - Model download failed
- `✅ WhisperKit is ready, processing audio...` - Should be transcribing

## 🚨 Most Likely Issues:

### Issue 1: Simulator Microphone Permission
**Fix**: 
1. Open macOS System Settings
2. Privacy & Security → Microphone
3. Enable for Xcode and Simulator
4. Restart simulator

### Issue 2: WhisperKit Model Not Loading
**Fix**:
- First launch downloads ~40MB model
- Check internet connection
- Wait for download to complete
- Look for "WhisperKit loaded successfully"

### Issue 3: Audio Engine Not Starting
**Fix**:
- Check console for permission errors
- Reset simulator: Device → Erase All Content and Settings
- Restart Xcode

## 📋 Quick Test Commands:

1. **Check if app has permission:**
```bash
xcrun simctl privacy booted grant microphone com.jamesalford.NotedCore
```

2. **Reset and restart:**
```bash
xcrun simctl shutdown booted
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 15"
xcrun simctl launch booted com.jamesalford.NotedCore
```

## 🎯 What SHOULD Happen:

1. Tap record → Permission dialog (first time)
2. Grant permission
3. Console shows: `🎤 Processing audio buffer` repeatedly
4. Console shows: `🔊 Audio detected!` when you speak
5. Console shows: `✅ Transcribed: [your words]`
6. Text appears in the app's transcription field

## The key is checking the Xcode console - it will tell us EXACTLY where the pipeline is breaking!
