### üí∞ BUDGET REQUIREMENTS

#### Development Costs
- Additional development: 3-4 months = $30,000-60,000
- WhisperKit model hosting: $500/month
- Cloud infrastructure: $200-500/month
- Testing devices: $2,000

#### Legal Costs

### ‚ö†Ô∏è REALITY CHECK

**Current State**: 20% complete
**Actual Functionality**: 10% working
**App Store Ready**: 0%

**Time to Market**: Minimum 3-4 months with full-time development
**Success Probability**: Low without significant investment

### üéØ RECOMMENDATION

1. **DON'T launch as a medical app initially** - Too much liability
2. **Pivot to "meeting transcription"** - Safer market
3. **OR get funding** - This needs professional development team
4. **OR sell the concept** - License to existing medical software company

### THE HARD TRUTH

This app is a prototype/proof of concept, NOT a production-ready application. It demonstrates the IDEA but lacks:
- Actual working features
- Safety measures  
- Legal compliance
- Professional polish
- Real-world testing

**Bottom Line**: You're looking at 3-4 months and $50,000+ to make this App Store ready, and that's being optimistic.
