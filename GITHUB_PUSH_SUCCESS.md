## 🔧 Issue Resolved

### Problem
Initial push was blocked by GitHub's secret scanning protection:
```
remote: error: GH013: Repository rule violations found for refs/heads/main
remote: - Push cannot contain secrets
remote: - commit: 0bdc25a37f92f78322aa61d98165049a988688a0
remote:   path: push_incremental.sh:8
```

### Solution
1. Used `git filter-branch` to remove `push_incremental.sh` from all commits
2. Ran `git reflog expire` and `git gc --prune=now --aggressive`
3. Disabled compression: `git config --global core.compression 0`
4. Force pushed: `git push -f origin main`

### Result
✅ Secret removed from history
✅ All commits pushed successfully
✅ Repository clean and secure
