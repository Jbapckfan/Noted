# ✅ Transcription Issues Fixed

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **Live Transcription Repeating Phrases** ✅
**Problem:** Phrases were being repeated 10+ times in the transcription.

**Solution:** Added duplicate detection in `LiveTranscriptionService.swift`:
- Tracks last added text
- Counts consecutive duplicates
- Skips after 2 duplicates max
- Resets counter for new phrases

```swift
// Check for duplicates
if cleanText == lastAddedText {
    duplicateCount += 1
    if duplicateCount >= maxDuplicates {
        print("Skipping duplicate: '\(cleanText)' (seen \(duplicateCount) times)")
        return
    }
}
```

### 2. **Copy Button Missing/Wrong Function** ✅
**Problem:** Copy button was pasting instead of copying in transcription section.

**Solution:** Added proper Copy button in `ContentView.swift`:
- New Copy button with `doc.on.doc` icon
- Copies transcription text to clipboard
- Shows character count in status
- Disabled when transcription is empty

```swift
Button(action: copyTranscription) {
    Image(systemName: "doc.on.doc")
}
.help("Copy transcription")
```

## UI Improvements

### Transcription Control Buttons (in order):
1. 📄 **Copy** - Copies transcription text
2. 📋 **Paste** - Pastes from clipboard
3. 🗑️ **Clear** - Clears all text

## Testing Verification

- ✅ Build succeeded
- ✅ Duplicate detection logic implemented
- ✅ Copy function properly copies to clipboard
- ✅ Paste function properly pastes from clipboard
- ✅ Character count updates correctly

## How It Works Now

1. **Transcription without duplicates:**
   - Each phrase is checked against the last added text
   - If same phrase appears >2 times consecutively, it's skipped
   - Prevents the "echo" effect

2. **Copy functionality:**
   - Click Copy button → transcription text goes to clipboard
   - Click Paste button → clipboard content replaces transcription
   - Visual feedback with character count

## Build Status: **✅ BUILD SUCCEEDED**

The transcription system now works smoothly without annoying repetitions, and you can properly copy your transcribed text!
