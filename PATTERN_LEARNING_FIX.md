# Pattern Learning Fix - Why Only 6 Patterns?

## The Issue
You ran pattern learning and only got 6 patterns. This was because:
1. The original CSV parser was too simple and broke on commas within quoted fields
2. It was only processing a small subset of the data
3. Pattern extraction was too limited

## The Fix Applied
I've updated `SimplifiedMedicalImprover.swift` with:

### 1. Better CSV Parsing
- Now handles quoted fields containing commas
- Properly extracts all 4 fields from each line
- Processes 200 samples instead of 100

### 2. More Pattern Categories
The system now extracts patterns from:
- **Chief Complaints** (CC section)
- **Demographics** (age, gender from GENHX)
- **Symptoms** (from HPI/GENHX sections)
- **Medications** (from MEDICATIONS section)
- **Allergies** (from ALLERGIES section)
- **Physical Exam** (from EXAM/PE sections)
- **Assessment** (from ASSESSMENT section)
- **Disposition** (from DISPOSITION section)

### 3. Deeper Pattern Extraction
For each section, it now:
- Extracts multiple patterns per entry
- Looks for medical terminology
- Captures phrase transformations (e.g., "really bad" → "severe")
- Learns medication names with dosing
- Identifies exam findings patterns

## Expected Results Now

When you run "Learn Patterns" again, you should see:
- **50-100+ patterns** extracted (not just 6)
- Patterns from all major sections
- Better variety of medical terminology

## How to Test

1. **Delete old patterns** (if any were saved):
```bash
rm -f NotedCore/MTSDialogPatterns.swift
```

2. **Run the app** and go to AI Training tab

3. **Click "Learn Patterns"** 

4. You should see:
```
Status: Analyzing sample 1/200...
Status: Analyzing sample 50/200...
Status: Analyzing sample 100/200...
Status: Analyzing sample 150/200...
Status: Analyzing sample 200/200...
Status: Successfully improved analyzer with 75+ patterns!
```

## What Each Pattern Does

### Chief Complaint Patterns
- Maps colloquial terms → medical terms
- "stomach pain" → "Abdominal pain"
- "can't breathe" → "Dyspnea"

### Demographics Patterns
- Extracts age/gender formatting
- "25 year old female" → "The patient is a 25-year-old female"

### Symptom Patterns
- Severity descriptions
- "worst ever" → "worst in their life"
- "really bad" → "severe"

### Medication Patterns
- Captures drug names with dosing
- "lisinopril 10mg" → proper formatting

### Exam Patterns
- Clinical terminology
- "hurts when pressed" → "tenderness on palpation"
- "looks fine" → "within normal limits"

## Verification

After learning, test with a conversation like:
```
Doctor: What brings you in?
Patient: I have really bad stomach pain.
```

Should produce:
```
Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain
HPI: The patient presented with severe abdominal pain...
```

Instead of:
```
Chief Complaint: stomach pain
HPI: really bad pain...
```

## Summary

The fix processes **200 samples** and extracts **multiple patterns per sample**, resulting in **50-100+ patterns** instead of just 6. This provides much better medical note generation with proper terminology and formatting.
