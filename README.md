## 📱 Usage

### Basic Example

```swift
import NotedCore

// Initialize pipeline
let pipeline = UnifiedMedicalPipeline()

// Create session
let sessionID = try await pipeline.createSession(
    patientID: "12345",
    encounterType: .emergency
)

// Process audio
let audioData = // ... your audio data
let result = try await pipeline.processAudioChunk(
    audioData,
    sessionID: sessionID
)

// Get transcription and insights
print("Transcription: \(result.transcription.text)")
print("Clinical Insights: \(result.clinicalInsights)")

// Finalize session
let report = try await pipeline.finalizeSession(sessionID)
print("Summary: \(report.summary)")
print("Diagnoses: \(report.diagnostics)")
```

### With Security

```swift
// Initialize security layer
let security = HIPAASecurityLayer()
await security.initialize()

// Authenticate
let auth = try await security.authenticate(
    credentials: Credentials(
        username: "doctor@hospital.com",
        password: "SecurePassword123!",
        mfaCode: "123456"
    )
)

// Process with encryption
let encryptedAudio = await security.encryptAudioData(audioData)
```
