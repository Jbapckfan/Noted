## Test 1: Chest Pain - 10 Minutes (~1800 words)

```
Doctor: Hi, I'm Dr. Chen. What brings you in today?

Patient: Doc, I've been having this chest pain for about 2 hours now. It's really worrying me.

Doctor: Okay, tell me about this pain. Where exactly do you feel it?

Patient: Right here in the middle of my chest. It feels like pressure, like someone's sitting on my chest.

Doctor: And you said it started 2 hours ago?

Patient: Yeah, I was at home watching TV and it just came on. At first I thought maybe it was just heartburn but it's not going away.

Doctor: On a scale of 1 to 10, how bad is the pain?

Patient: I'd say about a 7. Maybe an 8.

Doctor: Does the pain go anywhere else? Your arms, jaw, back?

Patient: Yeah, actually my left arm feels kind of heavy and tingly.

Doctor: Any shortness of breath?

Patient: A little bit, yeah. I feel like I can't quite catch my breath.

Doctor: Have you been sweating?

Patient: Yeah, I was sweating a lot when it first started. I'm still kind of clammy.

Doctor: Any nausea or vomiting?

Patient: A little nauseous, yeah. Haven't thrown up though.

Doctor: Okay. Tell me, have you ever had pain like this before?

Patient: No, never. I mean, I've had heartburn before, you know, after eating spicy food or whatever. But this is different. This came out of nowhere and it's much worse.

Doctor: When you say heartburn, did you ever see a doctor about that?

Patient: No, I just take Tums when it happens. Usually helps pretty quick.

Doctor: And the Tums didn't help this time?

Patient: I tried that at home before coming in. Didn't do anything.

Doctor: Okay. What about physical activity? Were you doing anything strenuous when it started?

Patient: No, like I said, I was just sitting on the couch watching TV. I was relaxed, you know?

Doctor: Alright. Tell me about your medical history. Do you have high blood pressure?

Patient: Yeah, I've had high blood pressure for probably 5 or 6 years now.

Doctor: What medication do you take for that?

Patient: Lisinopril. I think it's 20 milligrams.

Doctor: Do you take it every day?

Patient: Yeah, I'm pretty good about it. I take it every morning with breakfast.

Doctor: Good. What about diabetes? Do you have diabetes?

Patient: Yeah, I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 3 years ago.

Doctor: What medications are you on for that?

Patient: I take metformin. I think it's 1000 milligrams twice a day. Once in the morning, once at dinner.

Doctor: Are you checking your blood sugars at home?

Patient: Yeah, I check them in the morning. They're usually around 140, 150. Sometimes a little higher if I ate something bad the night before.

Doctor: What about cholesterol? Have you been told you have high cholesterol?

Patient: Yeah, my doctor put me on a statin a couple years ago. Atorvastatin, I think?

Doctor: Do you know what dose?

Patient: I think 40 milligrams. I take that at night.

Doctor: Are you on any aspirin?

Patient: Yeah, I take a baby aspirin every morning. My doctor told me to start that with the cholesterol medicine.

Doctor: Good. Any other medical problems? Lung problems, kidney problems, anything like that?

Patient: No, nothing else. Just the blood pressure, diabetes, and cholesterol.

Doctor: Have you had any surgeries?

Patient: I had my gallbladder taken out about 10 years ago. That's it.

Doctor: Okay. Any family history of heart problems?

Patient: Yeah, that's what's got me scared. My dad had a heart attack when he was 55. He survived it, but it was bad. He had to have stents put in.

Doctor: How old are you now?

Patient: I'm 58.

Doctor: And your dad was 55 when he had his heart attack?

Patient: Yeah, so I'm past that age already. I've been thinking about that a lot lately.

Doctor: I understand. What about other family members? Mom, siblings?

Patient: My mom's okay, she's got high blood pressure but no heart problems. My brother is younger than me, he's fine. No issues.

Doctor: Alright. Do you smoke?

Patient: I used to. I smoked for like 30 years, pack a day.

Doctor: When did you quit?

Patient: About 2 years ago. My doctor really got on me about it after the diabetes diagnosis, so I quit cold turkey.

Doctor: That's great that you quit. I know that's not easy. What about alcohol?

Patient: I have a beer or two on the weekends. Nothing crazy.

Doctor: Any recreational drugs? Cocaine, anything like that?

Patient: No, never.

Doctor: Okay. Let me ask you about today specifically. Did you eat anything unusual? Any new medications? Any stress or arguments?

Patient: No, nothing like that. I ate lunch around noon, just a sandwich. Nothing unusual. No new meds. Work's been stressful but no more than usual.

Doctor: What do you do for work?

Patient: I'm in accounting. Lots of sitting, lots of computer work.

Doctor: So pretty sedentary?

Patient: Yeah, unfortunately. I know I should exercise more but I just don't have the energy after work, you know?

Doctor: I understand. Alright, let me check you over now. Let me get your vital signs first.

Nurse: Blood pressure is 168 over 95. Heart rate is 102. Respiratory rate is 18. Temperature is 98.4. Oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.

Doctor: Okay, so your blood pressure is elevated and your heart rate is a bit fast. That could be from pain and anxiety. Let me listen to your heart.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: Take some deep breaths for me. Good. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Let me listen to your lungs. Deep breath in and out. Good. Lungs are clear.

Patient: That's good, right?

Doctor: Your heart and lungs sound okay on exam, yes. But that doesn't rule out what we need to rule out. Let me check your belly. Does this hurt when I press?

Patient: No, that's fine.

Doctor: Good. Any swelling in your legs?

Patient: No.

Doctor: Okay. Let me check your pulses. Arms feel good, equal on both sides. Legs are good too.

Patient: So what do you think is going on?

Doctor: Based on what you're telling me - the chest pressure, the radiation to your arm, the sweating, the nausea - and your risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, family history, and your history of smoking - we need to rule out a heart attack. This could absolutely be your heart.

Patient: Oh god. Really?

Doctor: I'm not saying it definitely is, but we need to find out. The good news is you came in quickly, and if this is a heart attack, we're in the window where we can do something about it.

Patient: What are you going to do?

Doctor: First, I'm going to give you some aspirin to chew right now. That helps if this is a heart problem. Then I'm going to start an IV and give you some medications. I need to do an EKG right away - that's the heart tracing that takes about 30 seconds. I'm also going to draw some blood to check for troponin, which is a marker that gets elevated when there's heart damage.

Patient: How long does that take?

Doctor: The EKG I'll have in just a few minutes. The blood test takes about an hour for results. But here's the important thing - sometimes the first troponin is normal and we need to repeat it a few hours later because it takes time for it to show up.

Patient: So I'm going to be here a while?

Doctor: Yes, I'm going to admit you to our observation unit where we can monitor you continuously. We'll repeat the troponin in 3 hours. We'll also repeat the EKG. If both are normal and you're feeling better, you might be able to go home. If either one is abnormal, we'll need to get cardiology involved and you'll probably need to be admitted to the hospital.

Patient: What about treatment? Can you give me something for the pain?

Doctor: Absolutely. I'm going to give you morphine through the IV for pain. I'm also going to give you nitroglycerin under your tongue. That can help if this is heart-related. It might give you a headache and it might make your blood pressure drop a little, but that's okay.

Patient: Alright.

Doctor: I'm also going to start you on a couple other medications - some blood thinners to prevent any clots from getting bigger.

Patient: You said blood thinners?

Doctor: Yes, we use medications like heparin or other anticoagulants if we're worried about heart attack. They prevent clots from forming or getting worse.

Patient: Is that dangerous? What if I start bleeding?

Doctor: We monitor you very closely. The risk of not treating a heart attack is much higher than the risk of the blood thinners. We check your blood counts and we watch for any signs of bleeding.

Patient: Okay, if you think that's what we need to do.

Doctor: I do. Your safety is my top priority. The nurse is going to get you set up now. Do you have any other questions for me?

Patient: Will I need surgery? Like will I need stents or bypass or something?

Doctor: We don't know yet. That depends on what the tests show. If the EKG shows a major heart attack, we might need to take you to the cath lab right away to open up the artery. If it's a smaller heart attack, we might be able to manage it with medications and then do a stress test or cath later. If everything looks good, you won't need any procedures.

Patient: Man, this is scary.

Doctor: I know it is. But you did the right thing coming in. We're going to figure this out and take care of you. The nurse will be right back with the aspirin and to start your IV. I'll check on you once we get the EKG back.

Patient: Thanks, doc.

Doctor: You're welcome. We'll get through this.

## Test 2: Abdominal Pain - 12 Minutes (~2100 words)

```
Doctor: Hi, I'm Dr. Martinez. What's bringing you to the ER today?

Patient: I've got this really bad stomach pain. It's been going on since yesterday and it's just getting worse.

Doctor: Okay, I'm sorry to hear that. Let's figure out what's going on. Can you show me where the pain is?

Patient: So it started yesterday here, kind of around my belly button. But now it's moved down here on the right side, like down low. That's where it really hurts now.

Doctor: Alright, so it started in the middle and moved to the right lower area. When exactly did it start? What time yesterday?

Patient: Um, I was eating dinner, so probably around 6 or 6:30 last night. I was eating and I just started feeling this crampy pain in my belly.

Doctor: What did you eat for dinner?

Patient: I had pasta with tomato sauce. Nothing unusual. My husband ate the same thing and he's fine.

Doctor: Okay. So the pain started around 6:30 last night. When did you notice it had moved to the right side?

Patient: I went to bed around 11 and I couldn't sleep because of the pain. I woke up around 1 in the morning and that's when I realized it wasn't in the middle anymore, it was definitely on my right side down low.

Doctor: How bad is the pain right now on a scale of 1 to 10?

Patient: It's like an 8. Maybe even a 9. It's really bad.

Doctor: Does anything make it better? Like changing positions or taking any medications?

Patient: No, nothing helps. I tried Tylenol at home this morning but it didn't touch it.

Doctor: What makes it worse?

Patient: Moving. Like, walking from the parking lot to here was awful. And when I cough or try to stand up straight, it kills.

Doctor: So you're kind of hunched over right now?

Patient: Yeah, I can't really stand up straight.

Doctor: Have you been vomiting?

Patient: Yes, I've been throwing up since this morning. I think I threw up like 5 times, maybe more.

Doctor: What are you throwing up? Food, or just liquid?

Patient: At first it was food, but now it's just this yellow-green stuff. It tastes awful.

Doctor: That's bile. Have you been able to keep anything down? Any water or food?

Patient: No, everything I try to drink comes back up like 20 minutes later. I'm really thirsty.

Doctor: I bet you are. We'll get some fluids in you soon. What about bowel movements? Any diarrhea?

Patient: No diarrhea. Actually I haven't had a bowel movement since yesterday morning. That's unusual for me because I usually go every day.

Doctor: Okay. What about urination? Any pain when you pee? Blood in your urine?

Patient: No, nothing like that. Peeing is normal. I mean, I haven't peed much today because I'm not drinking anything, but when I do go it's fine.

Doctor: Have you had any fever? Felt hot?

Patient: Yeah, I felt really hot this morning. I took my temperature and it was 101 point something.

Doctor: Do you have a thermometer at home that you used?

Patient: Yeah, one of those digital ones.

Doctor: Okay. Any chills?

Patient: Yeah, I had chills this morning. I was under a blanket shivering.

Doctor: Alright. Now I need to ask you some questions about your cycle. When was your last menstrual period?

Patient: It ended like a week ago. Maybe 8 days ago? It was totally normal, lasted the usual 5 days.

Doctor: Was the flow normal?

Patient: Yeah, completely normal. Nothing different about it.

Doctor: Is there any chance you could be pregnant?

Patient: I don't think so. I'm on birth control pills and I take them every day. And like I said, my period was normal.

Doctor: Okay. Are you sexually active?

Patient: Yes, with my husband.

Doctor: Do you use any other protection besides the pill?

Patient: No, just the pill.

Doctor: Alright. I still want to do a pregnancy test today just to be absolutely sure, okay?

Patient: Okay, I understand.

Doctor: Tell me about your medical history. Any medical problems?

Patient: I have asthma, but it's not bad. I only use my inhaler once or twice a week, if that.

Doctor: What inhaler do you use?

Patient: Albuterol. The blue one.

Doctor: Any other medical problems? Diabetes, high blood pressure, anything?

Patient: No, nothing else.

Doctor: Have you had any surgeries?

Patient: Yes, I had my appendix out when I was 12.

Doctor: You already had your appendix removed?

Patient: Yeah, I had appendicitis when I was a kid and they took it out.

Doctor: Okay, that's really important to know. What hospital was that at?

Patient: I don't remember, I was just a kid. It was somewhere in Ohio, that's where I grew up.

Doctor: Do you have any scars from that?

Patient: Yeah, I have three little scars on my belly from when they did it laparoscopically.

Doctor: Okay. Any other surgeries besides that?

Patient: Nope, just that one.

Doctor: What medications do you take regularly?

Patient: Just my albuterol inhaler for asthma and my birth control pills. That's it.

Doctor: What birth control pill are you on?

Patient: Um, it's the generic for Yaz. I don't remember the actual name.

Doctor: That's fine. Do you take it at the same time every day?

Patient: Yeah, I take it at night before bed.

Doctor: Good. Any allergies to medications?

Patient: Yes, I'm allergic to penicillin.

Doctor: What happens when you take penicillin?

Patient: I break out in hives. It happened when I was a teenager and they gave me penicillin for strep throat.

Doctor: Okay, so a true allergy. We'll make sure to avoid penicillin. Any other drug allergies?

Patient: No, just that one.

Doctor: What about family history? Does anyone in your family have any medical problems?

Patient: My mom has Crohn's disease. She was diagnosed like 10 years ago.

Doctor: Crohn's disease, okay. Does she have a lot of problems with it?

Patient: Yeah, she's been hospitalized a few times. She's on some medication for it, I forget what it's called.

Doctor: Anyone else in the family with bowel problems?

Patient: Not that I know of.

Doctor: What about your dad? Any medical problems?

Patient: He has diabetes but that's it.

Doctor: Okay. Do you smoke?

Patient: No, I've never smoked.

Doctor: Drink alcohol?

Patient: Socially, like maybe a glass of wine on the weekend.

Doctor: Any recreational drugs?

Patient: No, never.

Doctor: Alright. Have you traveled anywhere recently?

Patient: No, we haven't gone anywhere.

Doctor: Any sick contacts? Anyone at home or work been sick?

Patient: My coworker had a stomach bug last week but she's better now. I don't think I caught that though because this feels different.

Doctor: Okay. Now let me examine you. I'm going to check your vital signs first.

Nurse: Blood pressure 118 over 76, heart rate 102, temp 101.2, respiratory rate 16, O2 sat 99% on room air.

Doctor: Okay, you have a fever and your heart rate is elevated, probably from the pain and dehydration. Let me look at you. You do look pretty uncomfortable. Let me feel your belly. I'm going to press in different spots. You tell me where it hurts the most.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: Does this hurt? Up here near your ribs?

Patient: Not really.

Doctor: What about here on the left side?

Patient: No.

Doctor: Here in the middle?

Patient: A little bit.

Doctor: And here on the right side down low?

Patient: OW! Yes, that hurts a lot!

Doctor: Okay, I'm going to do something. I'm going to press down and then quickly let go. It might hurt.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: Here we go. One, two, three.

Patient: OHHH! Oh my god, that hurt so much worse when you let go!

Doctor: I know, I'm sorry. That's called rebound tenderness and it's an important sign. Let me check one more thing. Can you lie flat for me?

Patient: I'll try but it hurts.

Doctor: Okay, just relax. I'm going to lift your right leg up. Does that hurt?

Patient: Yeah, that hurts.

Doctor: Can you pull your right knee up to your chest?

Patient: Ow, yeah, that really hurts.

Doctor: Alright, you can put your leg down. Let me listen to your belly. Your bowel sounds are decreased. Let me check your back. Any pain here when I tap?

Patient: No.

Doctor: Okay. So here's what I'm thinking. Even though you had your appendix out when you were 12, there's something called appendiceal stump appendicitis. It's rare, but it can happen. Basically, if they left a little bit of tissue behind, that tissue can get inflamed just like a regular appendix.

Patient: Wait, I thought once your appendix is out, you can't get appendicitis again?

Doctor: That's what most people think, and usually that's true. But there are documented cases where a small stump of tissue is left behind and it can become inflamed years later. It's rare - happens in maybe 1 in 50,000 people who've had an appendectomy - but it's a real thing.

Patient: So you think that's what this is?

Doctor: It's one possibility. The way your pain moved from the middle to the right lower quadrant, the rebound tenderness, the fever, the vomiting - that's all classic for appendicitis. But since you're a woman of childbearing age, we also have to think about gynecologic causes. You could have an ovarian cyst that ruptured or twisted. You could have an ectopic pregnancy even though your period was normal. Or this could be something else entirely.

Patient: What else could it be?

Doctor: Given your mom's history of Crohn's disease, we should also consider inflammatory bowel disease. Sometimes the first presentation of Crohn's can mimic appendicitis. You could have a kidney stone. There are a lot of possibilities.

Patient: So what do we do?

Doctor: I need to do some tests. First, I'm going to start an IV and give you fluids because you're dehydrated from all the vomiting. I'm going to give you something for pain and something for nausea. Then I need to get some blood work - a complete blood count to check for infection, a metabolic panel to check your electrolytes, and a pregnancy test.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: Most importantly, I need to get a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. That's the best test to see what's going on in there. We'll use IV contrast to light everything up.

Patient: How long will that take?

Doctor: The CT should happen within the next 30 to 45 minutes. The blood work takes about an hour for results.

Patient: And then what?

Doctor: It depends on what we find. If the CT shows appendiceal stump inflammation or an abscess, I'll call the surgical team and you'll likely need surgery. If it shows an ovarian problem, I'll call gynecology. If it shows signs of Crohn's, we'll get gastroenterology involved. The CT will guide us.

Patient: Do you really think I need surgery?

Doctor: The way your belly feels on exam, I think there's a good chance. You have peritoneal signs - that rebound tenderness we checked - which suggests inflammation of the lining of your abdomen. That's usually surgical.

Patient: Oh man.

Doctor: I know it's scary. But if you need surgery, it's better to do it sooner rather than later. If you have appendiceal inflammation and it ruptures, that's much more serious.

Patient: Okay, I understand.

Doctor: Now, because you're allergic to penicillin, I'm going to use different antibiotics. I'll give you ciprofloxacin and metronidazole through your IV. Those will cover the bacteria we're worried about and they're safe with your allergy.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: Any questions for me?

Patient: How long will I be here?

Doctor: If you need surgery, you'll be admitted to the hospital afterwards. You'd probably be here for a couple days. If you don't need surgery and everything looks good, you might still need to be admitted for observation. It's hard to say right now until we see what the CT shows.

Patient: Can my husband come back?

Doctor: Absolutely. The nurse can bring him back once we get you set up. He can be with you for the CT and everything.

Patient: Okay, thank you.

Doctor: You're welcome. We're going to take good care of you. The nurse will be right in to start that IV.
