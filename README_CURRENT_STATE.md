# NotedCore - Current State Summary

## 🎯 Project Goal
Build an iOS medical transcription app that beats Heidi, Suki, and Freed with perfect human-level transcription and summarization.

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE
**The app had PERFECT live transcription working earlier TODAY but is now completely broken.**

## 📱 What Should Work:
1. Open app on iOS Simulator
2. Tap blue microphone button
3. Speak into Mac's microphone
4. See live transcription appear instantly
5. Medical notes generated automatically

## ❌ Current Problem:
- ZERO transcription happening
- Was working perfectly hours ago
- User said: "even went back and corrected itself"
- Now: "not even transcribing one word"

## 🔧 Recent Changes (Possible Causes):
1. Type system changes (TranscriptionResult rename)
2. Added SimpleWhisperService
3. Modified async/await in ProductionWhisperService
4. Added debug logging

## 📁 Key Files:
- `AudioCaptureService.swift` - Captures audio
- `ProductionWhisperService.swift` - WhisperKit integration
- `SimpleWhisperService.swift` - Backup transcription
- `ContentView.swift` - UI
- `CoreAppState.swift` - Shared state

## 🚀 To Run:
```bash
cd /Users/jamesalford/Documents/NotedCore
open NotedCore.xcodeproj
# Select iPhone 15 simulator
# Press ⌘R
```

## 🔍 Debug:
Check Xcode console for:
- `✅ WhisperKit loaded successfully!`
- `🎤 Processing audio buffer`
- `✅ Transcribed: [words]`

## 📋 Quick Fixes to Try:
1. macOS Settings → Privacy → Microphone → Enable Xcode ✅
2. Reset simulator: Device → Erase All Content
3. Clean build: ⌘⇧K then ⌘B

## 💡 Remember:
- IT WAS WORKING PERFECTLY
- Don't add complexity
- Don't fake/mock anything
- Find and fix the specific break

## 📊 Success = 
Live transcription appearing as you speak, just like it was earlier today!
