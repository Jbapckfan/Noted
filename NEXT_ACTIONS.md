## ðŸ”§ SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

### Task 1: Implement MLX Framework in Phi3MLXService.swift

**Current File Status:** Service skeleton exists, needs MLX implementation

**Required Code Structure:**
```swift
import MLX
import MLXNN
import Foundation
import os.log

@MainActor
class Phi3MLXService: ObservableObject {
    @Published var status: ServiceStatus = .idle
    @Published var progress: Double = 0.0
    @Published var progressMessage: String = ""
    @Published var error: String?
    
    private var model: LanguageModel?
    private var tokenizer: Tokenizer?
    private let logger = Logger(subsystem: "com.notedcore.app", category: "Phi3MLX")
    
    // IMPLEMENT THESE METHODS:
    func loadModel() async throws
    func generateMedicalNote(from transcription: String, 
                           noteType: MedicalNoteType,
                           customInstructions: String) async throws -> String
    private func updateProgress(_ value: Double, message: String)
}
Implementation Steps:

Model Loading Pipeline:
swiftfunc loadModel() async throws {
    updateProgress(0.1, "Loading Phi-3 Mini model...")
    // Load model from bundle: phi-3-mini.mlx
    // Initialize tokenizer: phi-3-tokenizer.json
    // Setup inference configuration
    updateProgress(1.0, "Model ready")
}

Text Generation Method:
swiftfunc generateMedicalNote(from transcription: String, 
                       noteType: MedicalNoteType,
                       customInstructions: String) async throws -> String {
    // Build medical prompt based on note type
    // Run inference with MLX
    // Return generated medical note
}


Task 2: Implement Medical Prompting System
Create Medical Prompts for Each Note Type:
SOAP Note Prompt Template:
swiftprivate func buildSOAPPrompt(transcription: String, customInstructions: String) -> String {
    """
    You are a medical scribe. Convert this doctor-patient conversation into a professional SOAP note.
    
    SUBJECTIVE: Patient's symptoms, complaints, and history as described
    OBJECTIVE: Physical examination findings, vital signs, test results
    ASSESSMENT: Clinical impression, diagnosis, or differential diagnosis
    PLAN: Treatment plan, follow-up, medications, recommendations
    
    Conversation: \(transcription)
    
    Additional Instructions: \(customInstructions)
    
    Generate a professional SOAP note:
    """
}
Narrative Note Prompt Template:
swiftprivate func buildNarrativePrompt(transcription: String, customInstructions: String) -> String {
    """
    You are a medical scribe. Convert this doctor-patient conversation into a professional narrative clinical note.
    
    Create a flowing narrative that tells the story of the patient encounter, including:
    - Chief complaint and history of present illness
    - Clinical findings and examination
    - Clinical reasoning and impression
    - Treatment plan and follow-up
    
    Use proper medical terminology while maintaining readability.
    
    Conversation: \(transcription)
    
    Additional Instructions: \(customInstructions)
    
    Generate a professional narrative note:
    """
}
Structured Note Prompt Template:
swiftprivate func buildStructuredPrompt(transcription: String, customInstructions: String) -> String {
    """
    You are a medical scribe. Convert this doctor-patient conversation into a structured clinical note with organized sections.
    
    Format with these sections:
    CHIEF COMPLAINT:
    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
    DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:
    CLINICAL IMPRESSION:
    TREATMENT PLAN:
    FOLLOW-UP:
    
    Conversation: \(transcription)
    
    Additional Instructions: \(customInstructions)
    
    Generate a structured clinical note:
    """
}
Differential Diagnosis Prompt Template:
swiftprivate func buildDifferentialPrompt(transcription: String, customInstructions: String) -> String {
    """
    You are a medical scribe with focus on clinical reasoning. Convert this doctor-patient conversation into a clinical note emphasizing differential diagnosis.
    
    Include:
    - Clinical presentation summary
    - Differential diagnosis considerations
    - Supporting and opposing evidence for each possibility
    - Diagnostic plan and reasoning
    - Most likely diagnosis with rationale
    
    Conversation: \(transcription)
    
    Additional Instructions: \(customInstructions)
    
    Generate a differential diagnosis-focused note:
    """
}
Task 3: Connect to MedicalSummarizerService.swift
Update MedicalSummarizerService.swift to use Phi3MLXService:
swift// In MedicalSummarizerService.swift - UPDATE THIS:
@StateObject private var phi3Service = Phi3MLXService()

func generateMedicalNote(from transcription: String, 
                        noteType: MedicalNoteType, 
                        customInstructions: String) async throws -> String {
    
    // Delegate to Phi3MLXService instead of placeholder
    return try await phi3Service.generateMedicalNote(
        from: transcription,
        noteType: noteType, 
        customInstructions: customInstructions
    )
}
Task 4: Model File Setup
Run the model setup script:
bash# In your NotedCore directory
cd Scripts/
python3 setup_phi3_model.py
Add model files to Xcode project:

Drag model files into NotedCore target in Xcode
Ensure "Add to target" is checked for NotedCore
Verify files appear in project bundle

Required Model Files:

phi-3-mini.mlx (~2.4GB)
phi-3-tokenizer.json
phi-3-config.json
phi-3-tokenizer-config.json
model_info.json

ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
Code Quality Standards:

 Use @MainActor for UI-related properties
 Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
 Add logging with Logger framework for debugging
 Include progress monitoring for UI feedback
 Follow existing service patterns from WhisperService.swift

Medical Accuracy Requirements:

 Use proper medical terminology and abbreviations
 Follow clinical documentation standards
 Include diagnostic reasoning where appropriate
 Support custom instructions for specific scenarios
 Maintain professional quality suitable for actual medical use

Performance Requirements:

 Model loading completes in <5 seconds
 Note generation completes in 5-15 seconds
 Memory usage stays under 3GB total
 No blocking of UI during generation
 Graceful error handling for memory constraints

ðŸ“‹ IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST
Before Starting:

 Review existing Phi3MLXService.swift file structure
 Study WhisperService.swift for service pattern reference
 Check MedicalSummarizerService.swift integration points
 Verify MLX dependency is properly added to project

During Implementation:

 Test MLX imports work properly
 Implement model loading with progress updates
 Test basic text generation (simple prompt first)
 Add medical prompt templates
 Test each note type generation
 Monitor memory usage during testing
 Implement proper error handling

After Implementation:

 Test end-to-end workflow: Record â†’ Transcribe â†’ Generate Note
 Verify UI progress indicators work
 Test error scenarios (model loading failure, memory issues)
 Validate medical note quality with sample transcriptions
 Check performance meets targets

ðŸ”„ ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES IF BLOCKED
If MLX Integration Fails:

Verify MLX Installation:
bash# Check if MLX is properly installed
swift package show-dependencies

Test Simple MLX Example:
swift// Create minimal test to verify MLX works
import MLX

func testMLX() {
    let tensor = MLX.array([1, 2, 3])
    print(tensor)
}

Check Apple Silicon Compatibility:

Ensure running on M1/M2/M3 Mac
Verify Xcode is using Apple Silicon architecture



If Medical Prompts Don't Work Well:

Start with basic prompts and iterate
Test with sample medical transcriptions
Adjust prompts based on output quality
Add more medical terminology gradually

If Performance Issues:

Implement model quantization options
Add memory monitoring and cleanup
Implement background processing
Add user feedback for long operations

ðŸŽ¯ SESSION SUCCESS METRICS
Minimum Viable Success:

 MLX framework imports without errors
 Phi-3 Mini model loads successfully
 Basic text generation works (even simple prompt)
 One medical note type generates reasonable output

Full Success:

 All 4 medical note types work properly
 Performance meets 5-15 second target
 Memory usage acceptable
 UI integration smooth
 Error handling comprehensive

Stretch Goals:

 Custom instruction support working
 Medical terminology optimization
 Progress monitoring polished
 Ready for clinical testing
