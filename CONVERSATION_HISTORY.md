**Status:** Completed âœ…
**Files Modified:** 
- `SESSION_START.md` (created with NotedCore-specific details)
- `CURRENT_STATE.md` (created with actual project status)
- `NEXT_ACTIONS.md` (created with MLX integration tasks)
- `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md` (created with architecture decisions)
- `CONVERSATION_HISTORY.md` (this file)

### Accomplished:
- âœ… **Context System Created:** Built comprehensive session preservation system
- âœ… **Project Analysis:** Documented NotedCore's current 80% completion status
- âœ… **Architecture Documentation:** Captured dual transcription + MLX AI approach  
- âœ… **Priority Identification:** MLX integration in Phi3MLXService.swift as critical path
- âœ… **Component Mapping:** Identified working components (audio/UI) vs. needs work (AI backend)
- âœ… **Technical Specifications:** Documented Phi-3 Mini requirements and performance targets
- âœ… **Implementation Roadmap:** Created concrete tasks for MLX framework integration
- âœ… **Claude Code Setup:** Resolved installation issues, got version 1.0.48 working

### Project Understanding Established:
- **NotedCore Mission:** Professional medical transcription app for healthcare providers
- **Current Status:** Audio pipeline (100%) + UI (100%) + AI backend (60% - needs MLX)
- **Technology Stack:** iOS 17+, Apple Speech + WhisperKit, Microsoft Phi-3 Mini via MLX
- **Architecture:** On-device only processing for HIPAA compliance
- **Performance Targets:** <100ms audio latency, 5-15s note generation, <3GB memory

### Technical Decisions Made:
- **Context Preservation:** 5-file system (SESSION_START.md as entry point)
- **Never Modify:** AudioCaptureService.swift, ContentView.swift, WhisperService.swift
- **Primary Focus:** Complete Phi3MLXService.swift with MLX framework integration
- **Medical Prompting:** Implement 4 note types (SOAP, Narrative, Structured, Differential)
- **Integration Point:** Connect Phi3MLXService to existing MedicalSummarizerService.swift

### Issues Encountered:
- **Claude Code Installation:** Initial `npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code` required global npm install
- **Path Configuration:** User's npm prefix was `.nph-global` (non-standard but working)
- **Context Files:** Generic templates needed NotedCore-specific customization

### Next Session Prep:
- [ ] **Start with:** Read SESSION_START.md for NotedCore context
- [ ] **Primary Task:** Implement MLX framework in Phi3MLXService.swift
- [ ] **Files to Focus:** Phi3MLXService.swift, MedicalSummarizerService.swift
- [ ] **Success Criteria:** Basic medical note generation working

### Code State:
- **Build Status:** Pass (existing components working perfectly)
- **Audio Pipeline:** Production-ready with <100ms latency
- **Transcription:** 95%+ accuracy with Apple Speech + WhisperKit backup
- **UI/UX:** Polished 3-tab interface ready for AI integration
- **AI Backend:** Service skeleton exists, needs MLX implementation
- **Known Blockers:** MLX framework integration, medical prompting system
