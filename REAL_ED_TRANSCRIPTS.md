## Test 1: Chest Pain (Room 12) - ~5 minutes

```
Doctor: Hi, I'm Dr. Chen. What brings you in today?

Patient: Doc, I've been having this chest pain for about 2 hours now. It's really worrying me.

Doctor: Okay, tell me about this pain. Where exactly do you feel it?

Patient: Right here in the middle of my chest. It feels like pressure, like someone's sitting on my chest.

Doctor: And you said it started 2 hours ago?

Patient: Yeah, I was at home watching TV and it just came on. At first I thought maybe it was just heartburn but it's not going away.

Doctor: On a scale of 1 to 10, how bad is the pain?

Patient: I'd say about a 7. Maybe an 8.

Doctor: Does the pain go anywhere else? Your arms, jaw, back?

Patient: Yeah, actually my left arm feels kind of heavy and tingly.

Doctor: Any shortness of breath?

Patient: A little bit, yeah. I feel like I can't quite catch my breath.

Doctor: Have you been sweating?

Patient: Yeah, I was sweating a lot when it first started. I'm still kind of clammy.

Doctor: Any nausea or vomiting?

Patient: A little nauseous, yeah.

Doctor: Tell me about your medical history. Do you have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol?

Patient: I have high blood pressure and diabetes. And my doctor told me my cholesterol is high too.

Doctor: What medications are you on?

Patient: I take lisinopril for my blood pressure, metformin for diabetes, and atorvastatin for cholesterol. Oh and I take an aspirin every day.

Doctor: Do you smoke?

Patient: I used to smoke a pack a day for like 30 years. I quit about 2 years ago.

Doctor: Any family history of heart problems?

Patient: Yeah, my dad had a heart attack when he was 55. I'm 58 now so that's been on my mind.

Doctor: I can understand that. Let me check you over. Your blood pressure is 168 over 95, which is elevated. Heart rate is 102, a bit fast. Let me listen to your heart and lungs.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: Your heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Based on what you're telling me - the chest pressure radiating to your arm, the sweating, your risk factors - we need to rule out a heart attack. I'm going to give you some aspirin to chew right now, start an IV, do an EKG, and check some blood work including troponin which is a marker for heart damage.

Patient: You think I'm having a heart attack?

Doctor: We need to find out. We're going to get you to our observation unit where we can monitor you and repeat the troponin in a few hours. If everything looks good, you'll be able to go home. If not, we'll get cardiology involved.

Patient: Alright, whatever you think is best doc.

Doctor: We're going to take good care of you. I'll also give you some morphine for the pain and nitroglycerin under your tongue which can help if this is heart-related.

## Test 2: Abdominal Pain (Room 8) - ~7 minutes

```
Doctor: Hi there, I'm Dr. Rodriguez. What's going on today?

Patient: I've been having really bad stomach pain since yesterday.

Doctor: Okay, show me where it hurts.

Patient: Well, it started here around my belly button yesterday evening, but now it's moved down here to the right side. That's where it really hurts now.

Doctor: When did you first notice the pain?

Patient: Around 6 PM yesterday. I was eating dinner and it just started cramping. I thought maybe I ate something bad.

Doctor: And it moved to the right lower side? When did that happen?

Patient: I woke up in the middle of the night because it was hurting so much and I realized it wasn't in the middle anymore, it was definitely on the right side down low.

Doctor: How bad is the pain right now?

Patient: It's like an 8 out of 10. It's really bad.

Doctor: Does anything make it better or worse?

Patient: Moving makes it way worse. Even walking here from the waiting room hurt.

Doctor: Have you been throwing up?

Patient: Yeah, I threw up this morning maybe 5 times. At first it was food but then it was just that yellow-green bile stuff.

Doctor: Any diarrhea?

Patient: No diarrhea. Actually I haven't had a bowel movement since yesterday morning.

Doctor: Any fever?

Patient: I felt hot this morning and took my temperature. It was 101.

Doctor: When was your last period?

Patient: It ended like a week ago. It was totally normal.

Doctor: Any chance you could be pregnant?

Patient: I don't think so. I'm on birth control and my period was normal.

Doctor: Tell me about your medical history. Any surgeries?

Patient: I had my appendix out when I was 12.

Doctor: You already had your appendix removed?

Patient: Yeah, I had appendicitis as a kid.

Doctor: Okay, that's important to know. Any other medical problems?

Patient: Just asthma, but it's pretty well controlled. I use my inhaler maybe once or twice a week.

Doctor: What medications do you take?

Patient: Just my albuterol inhaler and my birth control pills.

Doctor: Any allergies to medications?

Patient: Yeah, I'm allergic to penicillin. I get hives.

Doctor: Important. Any family history I should know about?

Patient: My mom has Crohn's disease.

Doctor: Alright, let me examine you. I'm going to press on your belly. Tell me if it hurts. Does this hurt?

Patient: Ow! Yes, right there!

Doctor: I'm going to press down and then quickly let go. Tell me when it hurts more.

Patient: Oh god, when you let go it hurts so much worse!

Doctor: Okay, I'm sorry. I need to check one more thing. Can you lift your right leg up for me? Does that hurt?

Patient: Yeah, that hurts a lot.

Doctor: Alright. So even though you had your appendix out as a kid, there's something called appendiceal stump appendicitis where leftover tissue can get inflamed. It's rare but it happens. You could also have an ovarian cyst or torsion. We need to do a CT scan to see what's going on. I'm also going to start you on IV fluids because you're dehydrated from vomiting, give you morphine for pain, Zofran for nausea, and antibiotics. Because you're allergic to penicillin, I'll use cipro and flagyl instead.

Patient: Do you think I need surgery?

Doctor: Possibly. I'm going to call the surgical team to evaluate you once we get the CT back. The way your belly feels, you likely need surgery.

Patient: Okay, I understand.

## Test 3: Shortness of Breath (Room 5) - ~6 minutes

```
Doctor: Good morning, I'm Dr. Patel. What brings you to the ER today?

Patient: I can't breathe very well. It's been getting worse over the last few days.

Doctor: Tell me more about that. When did it start?

Patient: About 3 days ago I started feeling more short of breath than usual. It's been getting worse each day.

Doctor: Do you have any cough?

Patient: Yes, I've been coughing up a lot of stuff. It's yellow.

Doctor: Yellow sputum, okay. Any chest pain?

Patient: No chest pain.

Doctor: Any fever?

Patient: I felt warm yesterday. I didn't take my temperature though.

Doctor: Tell me about your medical problems.

Patient: I have congestive heart failure, COPD, and high blood pressure. I also have AFib.

Doctor: What medications do you take?

Patient: I take Lasix, that's my water pill. Advair for my lungs. Lisinopril for blood pressure. And I'm on Eliquis for my AFib.

Doctor: Have you been taking your Lasix regularly?

Patient: Well, sometimes I skip it because I don't want to be running to the bathroom all the time.

Doctor: That might be part of the problem. When did you last take it?

Patient: Maybe 2 or 3 days ago.

Doctor: Let me check your oxygen level. It's 88% on room air. That's low. Let me put some oxygen on you. There, now you're 94%. Better?

Patient: Yeah, that helps.

Doctor: Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. Heart rate is 98. Let me listen. I can hear some crackles in your lungs at the bases. I also notice your neck veins are pretty prominent. Let me check your legs. Yeah, you've got some swelling in your ankles.

Patient: My legs have been swelling the last few days too.

Doctor: Okay. So you're having a couple things going on. Your heart failure is acting up, probably because you stopped taking your Lasix. But you also have some findings that make me think you might have a pneumonia on top of that. I'm going to get a chest x-ray and some blood work. I'm going to give you some breathing treatments, IV Lasix to get some of that fluid off, and I'm going to start you on an antibiotic called levofloxacin for possible pneumonia.

Patient: Am I going to be admitted?

Doctor: Yes, I think you need to be in the hospital for at least a couple days. We need to get your breathing better and make sure we treat the infection. I'll admit you to the medicine service.

Patient: Alright, if that's what needs to happen.

Doctor: We'll get you feeling better. The treatments should help pretty quickly.
