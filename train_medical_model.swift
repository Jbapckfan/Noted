        What brings you in today?
        I woke up this morning with really bad chest pain and couldn't catch my breath.
        When did it start?
        Around 5 AM, about 2 hours ago.

        Yes, down my left arm and into my jaw.
        Any other symptoms?
        I'm nauseous and sweating a lot. Hard to take a deep breath.
        Medical history?
        High blood pressure and high cholesterol. I take lisinopril 10 mg daily and atorvastatin 20 mg at night.
        Do you smoke?
        I quit 2 years ago but still vape sometimes.
        Family history?
        My dad had a heart attack at 55.

        HPI: Middle-aged patient presenting with acute chest pain onset 2 hours prior to arrival. Pain characterized as central chest pressure, 8/10 severity, with radiation to left arm and jaw. Associated symptoms include shortness of breath, nausea, and diaphoresis.

        PMH: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia
        Medications: Lisinopril 10mg daily, Atorvastatin 20mg nightly
        Social: Former smoker (quit 2 years ago), current vaping
        Family: Father with MI at age 55

        Assessment: Acute chest pain concerning for ACS given pain quality, radiation pattern, associated symptoms, and cardiac risk factors.

        Plan: Immediate cardiac workup - EKG, troponin series, CXR. Aspirin 325mg given. Cardiology consulted. Patient to monitored telemetry bed.

        What's going on?
        I have this terrible headache on the right side of my head. Started yesterday afternoon.
        Where exactly?
        Right side, mostly behind my eye. It's pounding.
        How bad is it?
        Like a 9 out of 10. Worst I've ever had.
        Any other symptoms?
        Light really bothers me and I threw up twice.
        First time with a headache like this?
        No, I get migraines sometimes but never this bad.
        What do you usually take?
        Ibuprofen 800 mg. It usually helps but not this time.
        Any recent head injury or fever?
        No.

        Medications: Ibuprofen 800mg PRN - typically effective, but current episode refractory

        Pertinent Negatives: No head trauma, no fever

        Assessment: Severe migraine headache with atypical severity. Consider secondary causes given "worst headache" characterization.

        Plan: IV fluids, antiemetics, migraine cocktail (Toradol/Benadryl/Reglan). If no improvement, consider CT head to rule out secondary causes. Neurology follow-up.
