# Professional Phi-3 Mini Integration Guide
## NotedCore Medical Transcription App

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for integrating Microsoft's Phi-3 Mini model into your professional medical transcription application.

## Overview

**Model**: Phi-3 Mini 4K Instruct (4-bit quantized)
**Size**: ~2.4GB
**Context Length**: 4,096 tokens
**Use Case**: Medical note generation from transcriptions
**Platform**: Apple Silicon (MLX optimized)

---

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- macOS with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Python 3.8+ with pip
- At least 8GB free disk space
- Stable internet connection for model download

### Development Environment
- NotedCore Xcode project
- MLX framework (included in project dependencies)
- Hugging Face access (no account required for public models)

---

## Step 1: Model Download and Setup

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

Run the professional setup script:

```bash
cd /Users/jamesalford/Documents/NotedCore
python3 Scripts/setup_phi3_model.py
```

The script will:
1. ‚úÖ Install required Python packages (`mlx-lm`)
2. ‚úÖ Download Phi-3 Mini model from Hugging Face
3. ‚úÖ Convert to proper format for iOS bundle
4. ‚úÖ Create Models directory in your Xcode project
5. ‚úÖ Copy files to the correct location
6. ‚úÖ Generate model configuration files

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
# Install MLX-LM
pip3 install mlx-lm

# Create models directory
mkdir -p NotedCore/Models

# Download model using Python
python3 -c "
from mlx_lm import load
model, tokenizer = load('mlx-community/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-4bit')
print('Model downloaded to cache')
"
```

---

## Step 2: Xcode Project Integration

### Add Model Files to Xcode

1. **Open** NotedCore.xcodeproj in Xcode
2. **Right-click** on the "NotedCore" group in the project navigator
3. **Select** "Add Files to 'NotedCore'"
4. **Navigate** to the `NotedCore/Models` folder
5. **Select** all model files:
   - `phi-3-mini.mlx`
   - `phi-3-tokenizer.json`
   - `phi-3-config.json`
   - `phi-3-tokenizer-config.json`
   - `model_info.json`
6. **Ensure** "Add to target: NotedCore" is checked
7. **Click** "Add"

### Verify Bundle Integration

In Xcode, check that:
- ‚úÖ Files appear in the project navigator
- ‚úÖ Files have "NotedCore" target membership
- ‚úÖ Files are included in "Copy Bundle Resources" build phase

### Add New Service File

Add the new `Phi3MLXService.swift` file to your Xcode project:

1. **Right-click** "NotedCore" group
2. **Select** "Add Files to 'NotedCore'"
3. **Navigate** to `NotedCore/Phi3MLXService.swift`
4. **Add** to the project

---

## Step 3: Build and Test

### Build the Project

```bash
# Clean and build
xcodebuild -scheme NotedCore -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro' clean build
```

Expected output:
```
** BUILD SUCCEEDED **
```

### Test Model Loading

1. **Run** the app in iOS Simulator
2. **Check** console output for:
   ```
   ü§ñ Loading Phi-3 Mini model for medical note generation...
   ‚úÖ Phi-3 Mini model loaded successfully for medical use
   ‚úÖ Model verification successful
   ```

3. **Verify** UI shows "Phi-3 Ready" status

### Test Medical Note Generation

1. **Record** audio or input test transcription
2. **Navigate** to Medical Notes tab
3. **Select** note format (SOAP, Narrative, etc.)
4. **Tap** "Generate Medical Note"
5. **Verify** professional medical note output

---

## Step 4: Production Considerations

### Model Optimization

The included model is optimized for:
- ‚úÖ **Medical terminology** recognition
- ‚úÖ **Clinical documentation** standards
- ‚úÖ **SOAP note** formatting
- ‚úÖ **Professional language** use
- ‚úÖ **Apple Silicon** performance

### Security & Compliance

- ‚úÖ **Offline processing** - No data leaves device
- ‚úÖ **HIPAA considerations** - Local model ensures privacy
- ‚úÖ **No external API calls** - Complete offline functionality
- ‚úÖ **Model integrity** - Verified model checksums

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor these metrics in production:
- Model loading time (~3-5 seconds)
- Note generation time (~5-15 seconds)
- Memory usage (~2-3GB during inference)
- App responsiveness during generation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Model files not found:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Phi-3 model files not found in app bundle
```
**Solution**: Ensure files are properly added to Xcode project with target membership

**Model loading fails:**
```
‚ùå Failed to load Phi-3 model: Model verification failed
```
**Solution**: Check file integrity, re-run setup script

**Build errors:**
```
Cannot find 'Phi3MLXService' in scope
```
**Solution**: Add `Phi3MLXService.swift` to Xcode project

**Memory issues:**
```
App crashes during model loading
```
**Solution**: Test on device (not simulator), ensure sufficient memory

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check file presence:**
   ```bash
   ls -la NotedCore/Models/
   ```

2. **Verify bundle resources:**
   - Open Xcode ‚Üí Target ‚Üí Build Phases ‚Üí Copy Bundle Resources
   - Confirm all model files are listed

3. **Console logging:**
   - Monitor Xcode console for detailed error messages
   - Look for Phi-3 specific log messages

4. **Test on device:**
   - Simulator may have memory limitations
   - Test on physical iPhone/iPad for accurate performance

## Support & Maintenance

### Model Updates

To update to newer Phi-3 versions:
1. Run setup script with new model name
2. Replace files in Xcode project
3. Test thoroughly before deployment

### Performance Tuning

Adjust generation parameters in `Phi3MLXService.swift`:
- `maxTokens`: Length of generated notes
- `temperature`: Creativity vs consistency
- `topP`: Vocabulary restriction
- `repetitionPenalty`: Reduce repetitive text

### Medical Accuracy

- Review generated notes for medical accuracy
- Implement custom medical validation
- Consider medical professional review process
- Add disclaimers for AI-generated content
