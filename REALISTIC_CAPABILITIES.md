   - High-security environments
   - Practices with strict PHI policies

2. **Cost-Sensitive Practices**
   - High-volume clinics
   - Practices with tight margins
   - Rural/community health centers

3. **Offline Environments**
   - Remote locations
   - Poor internet connectivity
   - International deployment

### Secondary Users
1. **Training Environments**
   - Medical schools (cost advantage)
   - Residency programs
   - Simulation centers

2. **Basic Documentation Needs**
   - Simple encounter types
   - Routine follow-ups
   - When sophisticated AI isn't needed

## Honest Competitive Positioning

### vs Heidi/Suki (Cloud Leaders)
**Where We Lose**: AI quality, clinical reasoning, summary sophistication
**Where We Win**: Privacy, cost, offline capability, data control

### vs Dragon Medical (Traditional)
**Where We Lose**: Accuracy, medical vocabulary, established workflows
**Where We Win**: Cost, modern interface, no training required

### vs Free Solutions (Otter.ai, etc.)
**Where We Lose**: General transcription accuracy
**Where We Win**: Medical focus, HIPAA compliance, note generation
