# ✅ Build Fixed and App Running!

## Fixed Issues:
1. **Type Conflict Resolution**: 
   - Renamed local `TranscriptionResult` to `LocalTranscriptionResult` in MedicalTypes.swift
   - This resolved the conflict with WhisperKit's `TranscriptionResult` type
   - Updated all references in ProductionWhisperService.swift

2. **Build Success**:
   - App now builds successfully: `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`
   - No compilation errors remaining

3. **App Running**:
   - Successfully launched on iOS Simulator
   - Process ID: 12455
   - Bundle ID: com.jamesalford.NotedCore

## Changes Made:
- `MedicalTypes.swift:60`: Renamed `struct TranscriptionResult` → `struct LocalTranscriptionResult`
- `ProductionWhisperService.swift:240`: Now uses WhisperKit's `TranscriptionResult` directly
- `ProductionWhisperService.swift:273`: Creates `LocalTranscriptionResult` for internal use
- `ProductionWhisperService.swift:335`: Handler accepts `LocalTranscriptionResult`

## To Test Live Transcription:
1. App is now running in the simulator
2. Tap the recording button
3. Speak clearly into your Mac's microphone
4. Live transcription should appear immediately
5. Check Xcode console for debug output

## Audio Pipeline Status:
- ✅ AudioCaptureService: Ready to capture at 16kHz
- ✅ ProductionWhisperService: WhisperKit integration fixed
- ✅ RealtimeMedicalProcessor: Ready to display live text
- ✅ UI: Recording button available

The app is now operational and ready for testing!
