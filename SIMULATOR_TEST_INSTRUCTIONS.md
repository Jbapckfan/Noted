# iPhone Simulator Test Instructions for NotedCore

## Test Objective
Test the complete summarization pipeline with a 10-minute ED encounter transcript to validate professional-grade output quality.

## Test Transcript Location
`/Users/jamesalford/Documents/NotedCore/test_10min_ed_encounter.txt`

This is a realistic 10-minute emergency department encounter featuring:
- **Chief Complaint:** Right lower quadrant abdominal pain with vomiting
- **Clinical Scenario:** Possible appendiceal stump appendicitis post-appendectomy
- **Complexity:** High (acute surgical abdomen with differential diagnosis)
- **Key Features:**
  - Classic pain migration pattern
  - Peritoneal signs on exam
  - Penicillin allergy requiring antibiotic modification
  - Family history of Crohn's disease
  - Multiple red flags requiring immediate surgical evaluation

## How to Test in Simulator

### Method 1: Direct Text Input (Recommended for Initial Test)

1. **Open Xcode** and load the NotedCore project
2. **Build and run** on iPhone 16 Pro Max simulator (iOS 18.0+)
3. **Navigate to** the encounter creation screen
4. **Copy the transcript** from `test_10min_ed_encounter.txt`
5. **Paste into** the transcription field or text input area
6. **Trigger summarization** by:
   - Tapping "Generate Note" button, or
   - Using the note generation function in EncounterSessionManager
7. **Review the generated note** for:
   - Completeness
   - Clinical accuracy
   - Red flag detection
   - Differential diagnosis quality
   - Treatment plan appropriateness

### Method 2: Programmatic Test (For Automated Validation)

Add this test function to your test suite:

```swift
func testTenMinuteEDEncounter() async {
    // Load test transcript
    let testFile = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "test_10min_ed_encounter", ofType: "txt")!
    let transcript = try! String(contentsOfFile: testFile, encoding: .utf8)

    // Process through summarizer
    let summarizer = ProductionMedicalSummarizerService.shared
    await summarizer.generateMedicalNote(
        from: transcript,
        noteType: .edNote,
        customInstructions: "",
        encounterID: "test-001",
        phase: .documentation
    )

    // Validate output
    let generatedNote = summarizer.generatedNote

    // Assertions
    XCTAssertTrue(generatedNote.contains("appendiceal stump"), "Should identify appendiceal stump as differential")
    XCTAssertTrue(generatedNote.contains("rebound tenderness"), "Should document peritoneal signs")
    XCTAssertTrue(generatedNote.contains("ciprofloxacin"), "Should use PCN-alternative antibiotic")
    XCTAssertTrue(generatedNote.contains("Crohn"), "Should document family history")
    XCTAssertTrue(generatedNote.contains("CRITICAL") || generatedNote.contains("ðŸš¨"), "Should flag critical findings")

    print("Generated Note Quality: \(summarizer.overallQualityScore * 100)%")
}
```

### Method 3: Real Audio Simulation (Most Realistic)

If you want to test the full audio â†’ transcription â†’ summarization pipeline:

1. **Use text-to-speech** to convert the transcript to audio
2. **Play the audio** while the app is recording
3. **Let WhisperKit/Apple Speech** transcribe it
4. **Review the complete pipeline** output

## Expected Output Characteristics

### âœ… Must Have (Critical Requirements)

1. **Complete HPI** with:
   - Timeline of events (18 hours, 6 PM onset â†’ midnight migration â†’ 6 AM vomiting)
   - Pain characteristics (8/10, RLQ, worse with movement)
   - Associated symptoms (vomiting, fever, chills, dehydration)

2. **Critical Physical Exam Findings:**
   - Rebound tenderness in RLQ (peritoneal signs)
   - Positive psoas sign
   - Positive heel drop test
   - Abdominal rigidity/guarding

3. **Red Flag Detection:**
   - Acute surgical abdomen alert
   - Peritoneal signs requiring urgent evaluation
   - Fever + acute abdomen = possible sepsis

4. **Differential Diagnosis** including:
   - Appendiceal stump appendicitis (primary)
   - Ovarian torsion/cyst
   - Inflammatory bowel disease (given family history)
   - Ectopic pregnancy must be ruled out

5. **Allergy Documentation:**
   - Penicillin allergy clearly documented
   - Alternative antibiotics selected (ciprofloxacin + metronidazole)

6. **Diagnostic Plan:**
   - CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast
   - CBC, CMP, pregnancy test, UA
   - All appropriate for clinical scenario

7. **Treatment Plan:**
   - IV fluid resuscitation
   - Pain control (morphine)
   - Antiemetics (Zofran)
   - Empiric antibiotics (PCN-free regimen)

### ðŸ“Š Quality Metrics Targets

- **Completeness:** â‰¥95% (all sections present and filled)
- **Clinical Accuracy:** â‰¥90% (correct medical reasoning)
- **Red Flag Detection:** 100% (all critical findings identified)
- **Differential Quality:** â‰¥85% (comprehensive, prioritized list)
- **Treatment Appropriateness:** 100% (evidence-based, safe)
- **Overall Quality Score:** â‰¥85% (professional-grade)

## Validation Checklist

After running the test, verify:

- [ ] Chief complaint correctly identified
- [ ] HPI includes pain migration pattern
- [ ] All symptoms documented (pain, vomiting, fever, dehydration)
- [ ] Timeline of events accurate
- [ ] Past medical history includes prior appendectomy
- [ ] Penicillin allergy documented
- [ ] Family history of Crohn's noted
- [ ] All vital signs captured
- [ ] Physical exam findings detailed (especially peritoneal signs)
- [ ] Red flags prominently displayed
- [ ] Differential diagnosis includes 3+ conditions
- [ ] Appendiceal stump appendicitis mentioned
- [ ] Diagnostic workup comprehensive
- [ ] Treatment plan includes PCN-alternative antibiotics
- [ ] Medical decision making explains clinical reasoning
- [ ] Risk stratification present
- [ ] Disposition plan clear
- [ ] Patient education documented

## Known Edge Cases to Test

1. **Prior Appendectomy Handling:**
   - System should recognize this DOES NOT rule out appendiceal stump appendicitis
   - Should include educational note about this rare complication

2. **Allergy Management:**
   - System must modify antibiotic choice based on penicillin allergy
   - Should explicitly state why alternative chosen

3. **Family History Risk:**
   - Maternal Crohn's should be flagged as increasing IBD risk
   - Should appear in differential diagnosis consideration

4. **Reproductive-Age Female:**
   - Must include pregnancy test in workup
   - Must consider gynecologic causes (ovarian torsion/cyst)
   - LMP documentation important

## Success Criteria

**PASS:** Note is of professional quality, suitable for EMR submission with physician review
- All critical information captured
- Clinical reasoning sound
- Treatment plan safe and appropriate
- Red flags prominently displayed
- Ready for real clinical use

**FAIL:** Note missing critical information or contains clinical errors
- Requires revision to core summarization logic

2. Test with actual audio input (if available)
3. Have clinical staff review output for accuracy
4. Make any final refinements based on feedback
5. Deploy to production with physician oversight
