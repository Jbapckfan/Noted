# MTS-Dialog Integration Summary

## Overview
Updated the RealConversationAnalyzer to generate narrative-style medical notes following the MTS-Dialog dataset format.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Narrative-Style HPI Generation
- **Before**: Bullet-point style fragments ("Onset yesterday. Severity 7/10.")
- **After**: Complete narrative sentences ("The patient is a 25-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of headache...")

### 2. Patient Demographics Extraction
- Now extracts age and gender from conversation
- Formats as: "The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender]"

### 3. Enhanced Chief Complaint Extraction
- Returns concise medical terminology (1-5 words)
- Examples: "Headache", "Abdominal pain", "Chest pain"
- Not raw text extraction

### 4. Improved Temporal References
- Converts time mentions to proper medical documentation
- "yesterday afternoon around 2 PM" → "Onset yesterday afternoon around 2 PM"
- "three to four weeks ago" → "The patient noticed this approximately three to four weeks ago"

### 5. New ED Note Sections Added
- **MDM (Medical Decision Making)**: Diagnostic evaluation, risk stratification, therapeutic interventions
- **Diagnosis**: Working or confirmed diagnosis
- **Disposition**: Admit/discharge/observation status
- **Discharge Instructions**: Return precautions, follow-up, medications (if discharged)
- **Removed**: Plan section (redundant with MDM)

### 6. MTS-Dialog Section Mapping
Aligned with MTS-Dialog standard sections:
- GENHX → History of Present Illness (narrative style)
- CC → Chief Complaint (concise terms)
- MEDICATIONS → Current medications
- ALLERGIES → Drug allergies with reactions
- PASTMEDICALHX → Past medical history
- FAM/SOCHX → Family and social history
- ROS → Review of systems
- EXAM → Physical examination
- ASSESSMENT → Clinical assessment
- PLAN/MDM → Medical decision making
- DIAGNOSIS → Working diagnosis
- DISPOSITION → Admission/discharge decision

## Testing Resources Created

1. **test_mts_dialog.swift** - Examples from actual MTS-Dialog dataset
2. **test_analyzer_output.swift** - Verification script for narrative output
3. **MedicalDatasets/MTS-Dialog/** - Full dataset available for training/testing

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

1. **Train on MTS-Dialog Dataset**: Use the 1,201 training examples to fine-tune extraction patterns
2. **Implement Section-Specific Extractors**: Create dedicated functions for each MTS-Dialog section
3. **Add Confidence Scoring**: Indicate when information is inferred vs explicitly stated
4. **Enhance Entity Recognition**: Better extraction of medications, dosages, conditions
5. **Validation Against Test Sets**: Use the 200-example test sets for accuracy measurement

## Files Modified

- `NotedCore/RealConversationAnalyzer.swift` - Main analyzer with narrative HPI generation
- Added test files for validation
- Created this summary documentation

## Success Metrics

The analyzer now produces:
- ✅ Complete narrative sentences instead of fragments
- ✅ Patient demographics when available
- ✅ Temporal information in medical format
- ✅ Associated symptoms in readable prose
- ✅ Treatment documentation when mentioned
- ✅ All required ED note sections
