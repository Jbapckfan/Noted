    Patient: Well, it started maybe three days ago, no wait, actually it was Tuesday because 
    I remember I was at my daughter's house for dinner. We had chicken, which might be 
    relevant because I felt sick after. But anyway, I started having this pain in my chest, 
    not really bad at first, just annoying. I took some Tums thinking it was heartburn from 
    the spicy food. My daughter makes everything too spicy. The pain got worse yesterday when 
    I was walking up the stairs to get my mail. I had to stop and catch my breath. I've been 
    tired lately too, but I thought that was just from not sleeping well. My husband snores 
    terribly. Oh, and my left arm has been feeling heavy, but I figured I slept on it wrong.

    Chief Complaint: Chest pain x3 days
    HPI: 
    - Onset: 3 days ago (Tuesday)
    - Character: Progressive worsening
    - Associated symptoms: Dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, left arm heaviness
    - Aggravating factors: Physical exertion (climbing stairs)
    - Attempted treatment: Calcium carbonate (Tums) - ineffective
    RED FLAGS: Chest pain + DOE + left arm symptoms ‚Üí Possible cardiac etiology

PATIENT RAMBLING:
"Doctor, I don't know what's wrong with me. I've been feeling awful for about a week. 
It started when I was at work - I work at the grocery store, been there 15 years - and 
suddenly I felt like I was going to pass out. My manager, Bob, he's really nice, he let 
me sit down in the break room. I drank some water and felt better. But then it happened 
again the next day. I was stocking shelves, the cereal aisle, and boom - everything went 
black for a second. I didn't actually fall but I had to grab the shelf. I've been 
drinking lots of water because I thought maybe I was dehydrated. My sister said I should 
eat more salt. I've been dizzy on and off since then. Oh, and I forgot to mention, I've 
been having these headaches too. Not terrible, but annoying. And I'm on blood pressure 
medicine, the little white pills, I think they're called lisinopril? I sometimes forget 
to take them though. My blood pressure was really high at the pharmacy machine last month, 
like 190 over something."

WHAT AI SHOULD EXTRACT:
Chief Complaint: Near-syncope episodes x1 week

HPI:
- Two near-syncope episodes in past week
- First episode: At work, resolved with rest and hydration
- Second episode: Next day while standing/working, visual changes ("went black"), 
  required support to prevent fall
- Associated: Intermittent dizziness x1 week, mild headaches
- PMH: Hypertension (poorly controlled)
- Medications: Lisinopril (poor compliance admitted)
- Recent BP: 190/? (pharmacy reading)

ASSESSMENT: 
- Orthostatic hypotension vs medication-related
- Poorly controlled HTN with medication non-compliance
- Rule out cardiac arrhythmia

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
- BP 190 systolic (pharmacy)
- Medication non-compliance
- Recurrent near-syncope episodes
