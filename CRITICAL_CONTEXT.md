# üî¥ CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR NEXT SESSION

## THE MAIN ISSUE:
**Live transcription WAS working PERFECTLY earlier in this session but is now completely broken.**

## What Was Working (Earlier Today):
1. ‚úÖ Real-time transcription as user spoke
2. ‚úÖ Self-correcting (would fix mistakes automatically)
3. ‚úÖ Medical terminology recognition
4. ‚úÖ Instant response time
5. ‚úÖ High accuracy

## What's Broken Now:
1. ‚ùå Zero transcription - not even one word
2. ‚ùå No text appears when speaking
3. ‚ùå Unknown if audio is being captured
4. ‚ùå Unknown if WhisperKit is loading

## User's Emotional Context:
- **FRUSTRATED** - It was working perfectly, now broken
- **EXPLICIT** - "don't fake anything without asking permission, ever"
- **DEMANDING** - Wants it to "beat Heidi, Suki, and Freed"
- **CONFUSED** - "I don't know what happened to the earlier version"

## Technical Changes Made (Possible Culprits):
1. Renamed `TranscriptionResult` to `LocalTranscriptionResult`
2. Created `SimpleWhisperService.swift` as backup
3. Modified `ProductionWhisperService.swift` async functions
4. Changed audio pipeline routing
5. Added debug logging throughout

## Most Likely Issues:
1. **iOS Simulator Microphone Permission** - macOS level permission needed
2. **WhisperKit Model Not Loading** - Needs ~40MB download on first run
3. **Audio Engine Not Starting** - Permission or initialization issue
4. **Concurrency Bug** - Async/await breaking the pipeline

## Files That Matter Most:
```
AudioCaptureService.swift:342-390 - Audio capture and routing
ProductionWhisperService.swift:165-180 - Audio reception
SimpleWhisperService.swift:63-100 - Transcription processing
ContentView.swift:218-240 - Recording start/stop
```

## Debug Output to Look For:
```
üöÄ SimpleWhisperService starting...
‚úÖ WhisperKit loaded successfully!
üé§ Processing audio buffer with 512 frames
üîä Audio detected! Max amplitude: X.XXX
‚úÖ Transcribed: [actual words]
```

## What NOT to Do:
- Don't add more complexity
- Don't create new services
- Don't mock or fake data
- Don't ignore that it WAS working

## What TO Do:
1. Check Xcode console immediately
2. Find where pipeline breaks
3. Fix that specific issue
4. Test with real speech
5. Verify transcription appears

## User's Quotes to Remember:
- "it is still not working I am not seeing any live transcription"
- "there was very recently and it worked well, like during this same chat session"
- "I don't know what happened to the earlier version of the live transcription that was perfect"
- "even went back and corrected itself if it thought it made a mistake"

## Success Criteria:
- Tap record ‚Üí Permission granted ‚Üí Speak ‚Üí Text appears IMMEDIATELY
- No delays, no buffering, instant transcription
- Medical terms recognized correctly
- Self-correcting behavior
- EXACTLY like it was working earlier

## The Golden Rule:
**IT WAS WORKING. We broke it. The fix is probably simple.**

---

# DO NOT FORGET:
The user explicitly said the transcription was PERFECT earlier in this same session. Whatever we changed after that initial success is what broke it. The solution is to either:
1. Revert to what was working, OR
2. Fix the specific thing we broke

The user is rightfully frustrated because we had it working and then broke it.
