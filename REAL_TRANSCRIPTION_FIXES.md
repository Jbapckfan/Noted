# NotedCore: Real Transcription Restoration Complete

## 🎯 MISSION: ELIMINATE ALL FAKE DATA & RESTORE REAL TRANSCRIPTION

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED - App now processes REAL voice input only**

---

## 🔥 CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **FAKE DATA INJECTION ELIMINATED**

**Problem:** User reported "omg, this text is mocked, there is no live transcription happening"

**Root Cause:** `ContentView.swift` had fake medical scenarios being injected through Quick Test buttons:

```swift
// BEFORE (FAKE):
private func loadQuickTest(_ test: String) {
    switch test {
    case "Chest":
        testText = "Patient presents with chest pain that started 2 hours ago..."
    case "Abd": 
        testText = "Patient reports abdominal pain in the lower right quadrant..."
    case "SOB":
        testText = "Patient experiencing shortness of breath since yesterday..."
    }
    appState.transcriptionText = testText  // 🚨 FAKE DATA INJECTION
}
```

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Completely removed `loadQuickTest()` function
- ✅ Disabled Quick Test buttons UI elements
- ✅ Added comments: "User explicitly said 'don't fake anything without asking permission, ever'"

### 2. **AUDIO PIPELINE SIMPLIFIED & FIXED**

**Problem:** Two competing transcription services causing confusion

**Before (Broken):**
```
AudioCaptureService → ProductionWhisperService 
                    ↓
                    LiveTranscriptionService (redundant)
                    ↓  
                    RealtimeMedicalProcessor → UI
```

**After (Fixed):**
```
AudioCaptureService → ProductionWhisperService → RealtimeMedicalProcessor → UI
```

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Removed redundant `LiveTranscriptionService.shared.updateTranscription()` call
- ✅ Streamlined to single transcription path
- ✅ Verified audio flows correctly: `AudioCaptureService.processAudioBuffer()` → `ProductionWhisperService.enqueueAudio()` → `RealtimeMedicalProcessor.appendLiveText()`

### 3. **VERIFIED REAL AUDIO PROCESSING**

**Confirmed Working Pipeline:**
1. **Audio Capture:** AVAudioEngine captures real microphone input at 16kHz
2. **Processing:** WhisperKit (tiny.en model) processes actual audio buffers
3. **Display:** Real transcription results flow to UI via `RealtimeMedicalProcessor.liveTranscript`
